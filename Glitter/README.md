##Glitter

Glitter is a twitter-like clone web application. User's each have a feed they can post to, and they can follow other users to have those users' posts appear on their feed as well.

The sample demonstrates long-polling for immediate notifications and is self-contained (other than static resources such as images and css files served from the web).
