## BotStarter Kit
This sample is a starter kit for building a chat bot that works with Slack. 

The starter kit is written as a base for starting with a very simple working bot. With this starter kit, you can easily start writing your bot's business logic using simple, stateful C#. It requires no knowledge of underlying services, nor does it impose any architecture limitations on how to design your logic.
